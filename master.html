    <h1>Master Branch</h1>
    <p>The master branch is the default branch in Git. It is often considered the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state.</p>
    <p>When you create a new repository, a master branch is created by default. You can create other branches to work on features or fixes, and merge them back into the master branch when they are ready.</p>
